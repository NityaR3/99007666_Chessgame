## Description:
Chess is a game played by 2 people on a chessboard with 16 pieces each.My project
implements the chess game with OOP concepts in python. The chess game follows the
basic rules of chess and all the chess pieces only move according to valid moves for
that piece. Our implementation of chess is for two players (no artificial intelligence). It
is played on an 8*8 checkered board whic is been recreated with -s and |s.

_NOTE:_The pieces moves are defined as the most basic ones,not the high level moves like castling, Queen converstion etc.
## Recquirements:

### High level recquirements
| ID | High Level Requirements |
| -------- | -------------- |
| HLR1 |It shall allow two users or players to play the game interactively. |
| HLR2 |It shall allow to play the game from
remote locations. |
| HLR3 |It shall allow players to move and cut pieces |

### Low level requirements
| ID | Low Level Requirements |
| ----- | ------------------- | 
| LLR1 | Chess pieces rules and moves  |
| LLR2 | Python 3.7.4 and installments |
| LLR3 | Clear defined modules for clear access of classes |
| LLR4 | clear cut OOPs concepts |
